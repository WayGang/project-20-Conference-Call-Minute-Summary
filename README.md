# Solar Wind Classification
A program about Solar Wind Classifying.

## Introduction
Based on a paper, we have implemented a program on MATLAB to classify different kinds of solar wind. 
Though the classifier is efficient, a program on MATLAB may not convenient for all the users to user.
Therefore, we decide to use Python to implement this program on a client, which could be easier for people to use it.

## User Stories
As scientists, they could have lots of data about solar wind, but it takes time to
build their own classifier to classify the solar wind, so they could upload their data to
our server or website then we could show them the result. They would no longer need to 
build their own classifier.
